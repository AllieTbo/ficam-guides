If you would like to contribute to a specific playbook, navigate to that playbook and contribute through its repository.

You can use GitHub's in-browser editor to edit files and submit a pull request for your changes to be merged.

####  General Practices
This content is Vendor neutral. Marketing materials for Commercial Products should not be submitted. If you would like to contribute a page or content which includes Commercial Products and a specific references for development and engineering, please review the Commercial Product trademark or copyright guides from the Product Vendor and reference those guides in your Pull Request.  

#### Plain Language
Contributors should consider the audience when submitting content. Plain language benefits a broad audience. Review your proposed content for use of acronyms and specialized jargon before submitting.

####  Thanks

The idea for providing this content as open source, the contributing framework, and the licensing framework are based on work from [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov) and [NIEM](https://niem.github.io/).
